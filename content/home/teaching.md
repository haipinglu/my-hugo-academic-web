I lead the development of a course on [An Introduction to Transparent Machine Learning](https://pykale.github.io/transparentML/), part of the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk)’s [online learning courses in responsible AI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/funding-call-online-learning-courses-responsible-ai).

At the University of Sheffield, I am teaching two modules below, with teaching materials available on GitHub via links below and [video lectures on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/HaipingLu/playlists). See my [CV](files/cv.pdf) for my previous teaching experience.

- **Spring 2017-2023**: [COM6012 Scalable Machine Learning](https://github.com/haipinglu/ScalableML)
- **Fall 2018-2021**: [COM4509/6509 Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence](https://github.com/maalvarezl/MLAI)
