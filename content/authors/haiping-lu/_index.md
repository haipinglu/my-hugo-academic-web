<!-- Founding Director of the UK Open Multimodal AI Network -->

üèõÔ∏è I am a Professor of Machine Learning at the [School of Computer Science](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs) and the Founding Head of [AI Research Engineering](https://shef-aire.github.io/) at the [Centre for Machine Intelligence](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ai), University of Sheffield. I am also the incoming Director of the [UK Open Multimodal AI Network (UKOMAIN)](https://multimodalai.github.io/), funded by [EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc/), which builds on the [Meta-learning for Multimodal Data](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/meta-learning-multimodal-data) interest group at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). Subscribe to our [Multimodal AI Community mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/g/multimodal-ai-community-group) for updates on UKOMAIN. I also developed and lead a course on [An Introduction to Transparent Machine Learning](https://pykale.github.io/transparentML/), part of the Alan Turing Institute‚Äôs [online learning courses in responsible AI](https://www.turing.ac.uk/funding-call-online-learning-courses-responsible-ai).

üñ•Ô∏è My research focuses on *developing translational multimodal AI technologies for advancing healthcare and scientific discovery*. Applications include medical imaging (brain and cardiac), cancer diagnosis and treatment, materials and protein engineering, and drug discovery. I lead the development of the [PyKale library](https://github.com/pykale/pykale) to provide more accessible machine learning from multiple sources for interdisciplinary research, officially part of the [PyTorch ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/).

üèÖ I serve as an Associate Editor of [IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5962385) and [IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/aboutJournal.jsp?punumber=7274989). I was a recipient of a [Turing Network Development Award](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/turing-network-development-awards-call), an [Amazon Research Award](https://www.amazon.science/research-awards/recipients/haiping-lu), and a joint recipient of a [Wellcome Trust Innovator Award](https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.10029221) and an [NIHR AI in Health and Care Award](https://www.nihr.ac.uk/documents/ai-in-health-and-care-awards-funded-projects-2020/25625#Phase_2_projects).
